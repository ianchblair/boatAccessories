# boatAccessories

This repository comtains the blender files for accessories for a "Moonmist" model r/c boat.

These files are scaled so that 1 metre in blender represents 1mm on the print, or approx. 0.1m to scale on the boat. 

There are files for three types of navigation lamp, to be lit by a 3mm LED mounted through the central hole.

navStn  & nabStnCov: for a stern light (degrees), assumed mounted horizontally on the stern
navPsSmall & navPsSmallCov: for 112.5 degree port/starboard lights (identical - assumed to be mounted vertically, on cabin sides.
navMast: 225 degrees for a masthead (note: may require further work - or may not be needed if a painted LED will suffice).

Note that the *Cov files contain the LED cover, which must be printed in transparent or tranlucent material

There is also a file for a torroidal lifebelt ("lifebelt").
